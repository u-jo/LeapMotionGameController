This is a program that allows you to control your game with customizable key bindings using a Leap Motion Controller. 

By running the LeapMotionController class with a LeapMotionConnected, the user is able to control the games with default up, down, left, right and A and B controls (like a gameboy). 
However, these controls can be updated in game using the control panel. It currently supports additional action such as tapping and swiping.
